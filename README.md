# NokiaSnake

The famous Nokia Snake game made using Java Swing and FlatLaf library (for theming). Size of the snake will grow, colliding with walls ends the game and shows an gameover screen with your score which is also visible while you are playing the game.

> Don't forget to setup the library included in the "libs" folder in order for the source code to run properly.
